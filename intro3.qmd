Introduction

There are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them.

In this laboratory session, you will be identifying pathogens of the intestinal tract (Case study 5) using differential and selective media (Task 3A), and an API-20E set of biochemical tests (Task 3B). In Case study 6, you will be looking at some of the enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism using biochemical assays (Task 3C), and at the ability of microbes to grow aerobically or anaerobically (Task 3D).


CASE STUDY 5: The case of the contaminated spinach

The epidemiologists have linked a sudden outbreak of diaorrheal diseases to a particular batch of frozen spinach, but the aetiological agent has not yet been confirmed.

You are working as a microbiologist with the Food Standards Agency, which is looking into the case. You suspect that it may be one of the common culprits – E. coli, Salmonella, or Shigella – but you need to figure out which.

A small portion of the spinach was homogenized and plated out on non-selective nutrient agar, and isolated colonies then grown in pure culture.

Your task is to determine whether the isolated pathogen is E. coli, Salmonella, or Shigella using selective and differential media (Task 3A) and an API-20E strip test (Task 3B).


Pathogenic enterobacteriaceae like Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli are all relatively closely related, and they share a number of common characteristics – they are Gram-negative rods, non-spore-forming, facultative aerobes. However, they can be distinguished from one another by molecular methods or based on a number of biochemical tests, as can be seen in Table 3.1.

TASK 3A:	Using selective and differential media for the cultivation and identification of Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella sp.

MacConkey agar

MacConkey agar is a selective differential medium that is used for primary isolation of Enterobacteriaceae and related enteric Gram-negative bacilli and to aid in the identification of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Its composition is listed in Table 3.2.

MacConkey agar is differential as it contains a sugar and the pH indicator neutral red, which can help to distinguish between bacteria which are able to metabolise the sugar, and those which cannot. It is often supplemented with lactose, but can also be supplemented with other sugars, such as sorbitol. Fermentation of the sugar produces acid, causing precipitation of the bile salts present in the medium and a change in colour due to the pH indicator. Bacteria that are not able to ferment the sugars will instead utilise the amino acids present in the medium, producing ammonia and causing the pH to increase.


Therefore, following culture on MacConkey/lactose medium, strong lactose fermenters such as Escherichia species will produce red colonies with a surrounding zone of precipitated bile sometimes observable. The red colour is due to the indicator changing colour in response to acid production following lactose fermentation.

Slow or weak lactose fermenters such as Citrobacter and Serratia species may appear colourless after 24 hours or slightly pink after 24 - 48 hours.

Non-lactose fermenting microorganisms such as Proteus, Salmonella and Shigella species, with rare exceptions produce colourless or clear transparent colonies.


CASE STUDY 6. The case of the careless clinician.

You are working in a clinical microbiology with a friend, who has just left for holiday – leaving you to record the results from the last sample he was processing. You think he said that it was C. diff– or maybe E. coli – he was working on faecal samples earlier that morning. But you aren’t entirely sure and he isn’t answering his phone. (You need to get better friends.)

The patient can’t wait for a diagnosis until your friend gets back from his holiday, so you’d better figure it out for him. Your task is to determine whether the isolated pathogen is Clostridium or E. coli using biochemical assays (Task 4C) and by testing whether the pathogen is an obligate or facultative anaerobe (Task 4D).

Anaerobic conditions: A number of clinically relevant pathogens are obligate anaerobes and therefore must be cultivated anaerobically. In this laboratory, you will learn techniques for the anaerobic growth of microorganisms and perform biochemical assays to test for the presence of enzymes involved in aerobic growth. These complementary assays will help you to determine whether this clinical specimen is an anaerobe or an aerobe, and therefore aid in species identification.


TASK 3C:	Biochemical assays to identify pathogens of the intestinal tract

Test 1: Catalase test

Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The enzyme is a haem protein expressed by most aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria (excluding Streptococci species) and used to degrade any hydrogen peroxide that is generated during aerobic carbohydrate metabolism.


Test 2: Oxidase test

Cytochrome oxidase is a haemprotein enzyme that is involved in the terminal chain of aerobic respiration by transferring electrons (hydrogen) to oxygen, to form water. It is possessed by aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms. The test is helpful in screening Enterobacteriaceae (all negative), Pseudomonas (positive) or Neisseria (positive) species. The oxidase test uses a dye that can substitute for oxygen as an electron acceptor. In the reduced state the dye is colourless. However, in the presence of cytochrome oxidase and atmospheric oxygen it becomes oxidized and converts to a coloured derivative.

TASK 3D:	Determining whether the unknown microorganism requires oxygen for growth

There are a number of different techniques used in microbiology laboratories for achieving anaerobic conditions to permit the growth of different microbes. In this lab, you will use two different techniques: use of thioglycollate medium and use of an anaerobic jar.

Thioglycollate medium

This medium contains a reducing agent, sodium thioglycollate, that binds to and consumes O2 and thus maintains a low oxygen tension in the medium. The medium also contains a redox indicator, resazurin, which turns pink in an oxidized environment. It is essential to use fresh thioglycollate medium (as indicated by the absence of pink colour). Growth of organisms in thioglycollate medium will depend on their oxygen requirements, as illustrated in Figure 3.1.

The GasPak/Anaerobic jar technique

This system uses a sealed jar and a GasPak, which generates carbon dioxide and hydrogen; a palladium catalyst in the jar combines the hydrogen with oxygen (generating water); this then creates an anaerobic atmosphere in the jar, as shown in Figure 3.2. An indicator strip is used to verify that anaerobic conditions have been established: it contains methylene blue, which becomes colourless in the absence of oxygen.

You will streak two agar plates; one will be incubated aerobically; the other, anaerobically. Each plate should be divided in half (use a marker-pen to draw a line on the base of the plate). You will inoculate one half of each plate with your unknown organism and one half with Clostridium as a control. As Clostridium will only grow anaerobically, its growth in this experiment will confirm that anaerobic conditions were achieved in the jar with the Gas-Pak.


TASK 3F:	Staphylococcus aureus inoculation on mannitol salt agar

Mannitol salt agar (MSA) is a selective differential medium that is used for primary isolation and identification of potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus from non-pathogenic commensal microorganisms from the genus Micrococcus. MSA contains a relatively high sodium chloride content of 7.5% w/v which allows selection for microorganisms that can tolerate this level of sodium chloride. This makes the test selective. In addition, it contains mannitol and an indicator, phenol red. If a microorganism can ferment the mannitol, acid will be produced and the indicator will turn from red to yellow in response to the pH drop. This makes the test differential.

Staphylococcus aureus grows on MSA and ferments mannitol, turning the plate yellow. Microorganisms such as Staphylococcus epidermis although capable of growth on MSA, do not ferment mannitol. Members of the genus Micrococcus (e.g. Micrococcus luteus) cannot grow on MSA.

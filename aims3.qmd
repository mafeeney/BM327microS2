Aims

•	To understand how to identify unknown microorganisms affecting the intestinal tract using molecular and media-based techniques.


Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

•	How to identify pathogens of the intestinal tract using differential and selective media.
•	How to identify pathogens of the intestinal tract using and an API-20E set of biochemical tests.
•	How to analyses and identify microbes through their ability to grow aerobically or anaerobically.


Competencies

•	Using aseptic technique.
•	Pipetting.
•	Anaerobic cultivation of microbes.
•	Using appropriate methods to identify microorganisms (differential media, tests).
•	Documenting and reporting on experimental results and conclusions.


Importance

This laboratory session aligns with lectures and reinforces material relating to pathogens of the intestinal tract, bacterial identification and phylogeny, bacterial metabolism, epidemiology and clinical microbiology.

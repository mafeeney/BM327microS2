## Task 1A

In the next lab session, you will be able to observe your streak and spread plates. You will examine the colony morphology on each plate in order to learn about how colony morphology can aid in @sec-microbialID. 

You will also want to evaluate your plates to understand how competently you performed the tasks - whether and how you can improve your technique for preparing and plating serial dilutions, and streaking for single colonies.

### Task 1A - Evaluating your Streak Plates

We will help you to evaluate your streak plates and determine how you can improve your technique (if necessary). 

A good streak plate has the following characteristics:

* It has well-separated, distinct individual colonies

* It makes good use of all of the available space on the plate

* It is clearly and legibly labelled, with the label not obscuring the centre of the plate

Eight examples of streak plates have been provided in @fig-shame for you. Can you diagnose the error(s) - if any - that were made in streaking out each plate?

::: {.discussion-hints title="Hints - diagnosing streak plate woes" collapse="true"}

When trying to evaluate a streak plate, try to think of what actions could have produced that plate: which sector (quadrant) was streaked first? when/how often was the loop flamed? were any of the sectors inoculated with too many bacterial cells?

### Task 1A - Quantifying the Number of Microbes in a Sample: Serial Dilutions {#sec-ennumeration}

It is often necessary or desirable to work backwards from the number of colonies on a plate, in order to work out the number of *viable* microbes that were present in the original (undiluted) sample. (Note that any microbes present in the sample that were dead, or viable-but-not-culturable, will not give rise to colonies on the plate - so you are enumerating the number of viable microbes, not the number of cells.)

We calculate and express the number of viable microbes in the original sample in **colony forming units** (cfu) - usually in cfu/mL. 

For example, if you performed a decimal serial dilution, plated 0.1 mL of the 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution, and counted 173 colonies on the resulting plate (@fig-serialdilplated) - how many viable bacterial cells were present in the original culture? 

![Examples of plating and counting colonies from a decimal serial dilution](images/serialdilplated.jpg){#fig-serialdilplated}

Here, we had 173 colonies in 0.1 mL of the dilution present in the 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution tube. 

To calculate the number of cfu/mL present in the original sample, divide the number of colonies on your plate by the total dilution factor: in this case, 173 colonies/(0.1 mL * 10<sup>-4</sup>) = 1.73 * 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL. 

::: {.callout-tip title="Top tips for calculating cfu/mL"}

* Make sure you label your plates with the dilution factor - you will need this for the calculations!

* Ideally, you want to count colonies on a plate that has 30-300 colonies. We normally consider <30 colonies to be Too Few To Count (TFTC) and more than 300 colonies to be Too Numerous To Count (TNTC). You will get more accurate estimates of your viable cell count if you use a countable plate. 

* Make sure you use the correct number of significant figures in your answer - you can't be more precise than your initial measurement (number of colonies counted).

* Make sure you express your answer in scientific notation (e.g., 1.73 * 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL, not 17300000) and include units.

* When you've finished your calculation, double-check that your answer makes sense! For example, you can't have a fraction of a colony forming unit - so if your answer looks like 1.73 * 10<sup>-7</sup> cfu/mL, you have probably gone awry with your handling of exponents somewhere.

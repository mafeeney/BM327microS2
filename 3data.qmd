::: {.todo title="Lab 3 - Data Analysis Tasks"}

After attending the practical lab, you should:

* Compare the results from your blood agar plates with what is known in the literature (@sec-3Adata).

* Compare the results of your biochemical tests with what is known in the literature (@sec-3Bdata).

* Analyse the results from the API-20E test that was performed for you (@sec-APIdata)

* In lab 4, you will examine and record the results from your MacConkey and Mannitol Salt Agar plates. You should reread @sec-MacConkey and @sec-MSA to make sure you understand what to expect in the next lab session, and how to interpret your data.

* In lab 4, you will examine and record the results from your fluid thioglycollate cultures and your anaerobically incubated plates. You should reread @sec-oxygen to make sure you understand what to expect in the next lab session, and how to interpret your data.

## Task 3A Data Analysis {#sec-3Adata}

For the controls (<i>Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes</i>) - does the phenotype you observed match what you would expect based on the literature?

How precisely can you identify your unknown based on your observations? 

::: {#discussion-streak .discussion title="Interpreting the results from your blood agar plates"}

**Questions to consider/discuss with your lab partners:**

1. Are you confident in the accuracy of your results (are there any ways that your experiment could have yielded a false positive/false negative)?

2. What other experiments might help you to identify your unknown?

3. For Case Study 2 (suspected Group A Strep infection), what should the clinical microbiologist do next? What about the physician?

1. Consider your aseptic technique, any other potential problems with your experiment...?

2-3. You might find it helpful to refer to your lecture notes, the UK SMIDs for these organisms, or taxonomic resources such as Bergey's.

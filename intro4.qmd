Introduction

There are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. In this laboratory session, you will be identifying a pathogen of the skin and circulatory system, Staphylococcus aureus, using differential media (Task 4A), biochemical assays (Tasks 4B and 4C), and a PCR-based technique called MVLA typing (Task 4D).

Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are both members of the normal human skin flora (commensals), and dangerous pathogens often associated with nosocomial infections. Although Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis appear very similar when examined under the microscope (as in the Gram-staining procedure you carried out in laboratory session 1), they can be distinguished from one another on the basis of several different phenotypic characteristics (Table 4.1).

CASE STUDY 4: Epidemiology of an MRSA outbreak

A number of patients at the local hospital have been acquiring secondary infections after seeing Dr. X for routine medical procedures. However, many of the patients also move in the same social circles, and so it is not clear whether these infections are nosocomial or community-acquired.

As a consulting microbiologist from the NHS, you have been asked to help the hospital discover the source of the pathogens, so that they can clean up their protocols for infection control if necessary. The first step is to determine whether the bacteria isolated from the patients are all genetically identical (from the same source) or different (from different sources).

You will use selective and differential media to analyse your own commensal flora (results from laboratory session 2, Task 3E) and the unknown and control strains from the MRSA epidemic (Task 3A).

Your task is to identify the strains involved in the outbreak. You suspect that it is MRSA, but you must first confirm this. You will first determine whether the patient isolates are in fact Staphylococci using a lysostaphin test (Task 3B); you will then determine whether they are Staphylococcus aureus or other Staphylococci using a diagnostic coagulase test (Task 3C). Finally, you will identify a Staphylococcus aureus isolate using MVLA typing (Task 3D).

Coagulase is an enzyme that has prothrombin-like activity and is capable of converting plasma fibrinogen to fibrin with resultant clot formation. Coagulase can be present in two forms, “free” and “bound” each having different properties and requiring different testing procedures. In this laboratory we will use the more rapid test for bound coagulase, the so-called slide test. As not all strains of Staphylococcus aureus express bound coagulase a negative test result requires the free coagulase (tube) test to be performed for absolute confirmation.

If the previous tests have allowed you to determine that your unknown is Staphylococcus aureus, you will now be able to determine its identity more precisely using a technique called MLVA (multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis), which can discriminate between different strains of Staphylococcus aureus based on different numbers of variable tandem repeats in specific loci. You will amplify these loci using PCR, and determine the size of the PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the locus (PCR product) reflects the number of repeats present in your strain. If more repeats are present, the PCR product will be larger (see Figure 4.1). If your unknown was not Staphylococcus aureus, you will still be able to perform the MLVA analysis – use the Staphylococcus aureus culture that was provided as a positive control for the previous experiments.

You will be analysing five different loci in total; one in a single PCR reaction (the spa gene) in Protocol 4.3, and four in a multiplexed PCR reaction (the clfA, cflB, sdr, and ssp genes) as detailed in Protocol 4.4.

There are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. In this laboratory session, you will be looking at some of the phenotypic properties of bacteria that can contribute to their virulence (CASE STUDY 6, TASK 5A and TASK 5B) and using a differential stain to identify a potential pathogen (CASE STUDY 7, TASK 5C).

Introduction: Biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance

TASK 5A:	Analysing biofilm attachment of P. aeruginosa isolates

Biofilm formation is a key virulence factor for many clinically important pathogens, and is also a particular problem in healthcare situations, where biofilms can form on medical devices and be difficult to eradicate. Bacteria in biofilms are often more resistant to killing by antibiotics. Biofilm formation is a complex, regulated process that begins with the initial attachment of bacteria to a surface, often mediated by flagella, pili, or other surface proteins on the bacterial cell (Figure 10). This surface attachment is what you will measure using a crystal violet stain that binds to the bacteria.

You will be provided with a tube of medium, and three liquid cultures of Pseudomonas which have been grown overnight in that same medium. You will test whether these Pseudomonas sp. are able to form biofilms using a crystal violet assay.

Crystal violet will stain the bacteria but not the plastic. Therefore, attachment will be observed by the presence of a purple ring (Figure 11). This purple ring is made up of bacteria that have attached to the surface at the liquid-air interface.

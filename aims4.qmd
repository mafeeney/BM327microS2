Aims

•	To understand how to identify unknown microorganisms using molecular and media-based techniques.
•	To understand how to isolate and analyse plasmid DNA from microorganisms.
•	To understand how to carry out PCR and interpret the results from multiplexed reactions.


Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

•	How to use differential media to identify microorganisms.
•	How to use MVLA typing to identify microorganisms.
•	How to use PCR to identify microorganisms.


Competencies

•	Using aseptic technique.
•	Pipetting.
•	Using appropriate methods to identify microorganisms (differential media, tests, MVLA typing).
•	Using PCR to discriminate between bacterial species.
•	Documenting and reporting on experimental results and conclusions.


Importance

This laboratory session aligns with lectures and reinforces material relating to circulatory system and skin pathogens, bacterial identification and phylogeny, bacterial virulence and clinical microbiology.

## Identification of microorganisms by microscopic characterisation {#sec-microid}

The individual cells of typical bacteria are very small. To be seen clearly with a light microscope, they must be fixed to a glass slide, stained, and then examined using a microscope fitted with an oil-immersion lens (x100) which is capable of producing an overall magnification of at least x1000. (Note that the total magnification is the product of the objective and the ocular lenses â€“ e.g., for many commonly used light microscopes, objective magnification (x100) * ocular magnification (x10) = x1000 magnification.) 

The size, shape, and arrangement of the cells (@fig-cellshapes) can be helpful in bacterial identification. However, this information is rarely enough to make a definitive diagnosis - there are, for example, many rod-shaped bacterial pathogens. You will need to take other information into account (often using a dichotomous key, as discussed in @sec-dichotomouskey)

## Differential Stains 

Differential stains use multiple different chemicals which stain different cells, or cell structures, in a way which helps us to differentiate between them. Some common examples (and ones that you will see in this module) are the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain (which differentiate bacteria based on their cell wall structures). 

## The Gram Stain {#sec-gramstain}

The most common staining technique employed in microbiology is the Gram stain since it allows visualisation of the test bacterium under a light microscope and it is a discriminatory stain (i.e. it contributes to the identification of a microorganism, particularly when the information provided is used in conjunction with the macroscopic characteristics - @sec-colony).

The Gram stain allows us to characterize bacteria based on the structure of their cell walls, and moreover, observing the cells under the microscope and noting their shape and arrangement (@fig-cellshapes) can help to narrow down a preliminary identification. 
In the Gram stain (@fig-GramStain), test bacteria are first stained with crystal violet, which stains the cell walls of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Next, iodine is added as a mordant^[a mordant helps the dye to bind and fixes it in place]. The cells are then destained with alcohol and finally, counter-stained with safranin. The destaining step removes the crystal violet from Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive, cells; and therefore, only the Gram-negative cells are stained pink/red by the safranin counter-stain.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tips for making an excellent Gram stain"}

* Do not put too many cells on the slide - you will need to be able to observe the cells under the microscope (which means that light must penetrate through the film of cells - if it is too thick, you won't be able to see anything)

* Follow the protocol precisely - good attention to the timing of each step is very important, you do not want to overstain or over-destain, as this can give false results.

* Do not "overcook" the slide in the flame when you are fixing your bacteria - boiling the cells can change their arrangement and excessive heat can damage the cell walls

* Make sure you are wearing gloves when working with the stains, and removing your gloves when working with the Bunsen burners!!!

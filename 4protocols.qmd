TASK 4A:	Microbial colonies on MSA plates (from Task 2E)

You will analyse the growth and colony morphology of the unknown pathogen on MSA agar, and also the growth and colony morphology of your own nasal flora (from the plates you inoculated in laboratory session 2, Task 2E). You have also been provided with cultures of type strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis grown on MSA agar as controls. Record your observations in Table 4.2.

Protocol 4.2: Coagulase slide test.

1.	Place a drop of sterile water on a glass slide.

2.	Using a flamed loop, that has been allowed to cool, remove an isolated colony from the culture plate and gently emulsify on the slide with the drop of sterile water. 
3.	Place a drop of plasma immediately adjacent to the bacterial suspension and mix the two samples together.

4.	Gently tilt the slide back and forwards, observing for the immediate formation of a white precipitate.

Interpretation

A positive reaction (formation of white precipitate) is typically detected 15 – 20 seconds. The test is considered negative if clumping is not observed within 2 – 3 minutes.



Setting up PCR reaction mixtures

•	Work on ice.
•	Pipet carefully and accurately.
•	Watch what you touch – you are covered with nucleases and your own Staphylococcus aureus!
•	Stay organized – keep track of what you have added to your reaction and what still needs to be added.
•	Label your tubes – there will be 96 on the thermocycler altogether!

Protocol 4.3: Set up single PCR (spa gene).

The spa gene must be amplified separately as these primers do not perform well in the multiplex PCR reaction. The single PCR mixture contains: primers for the gene to be amplified (the spa gene), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq), dNTPs, the reaction buffer, and PCR-grade water.

1.	Label your PCR tube carefully with the gene name (spa) and your bench number.

2.	Use a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.

3.	Keep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step (thermocycler).

Protocol 4.4: Set up multiplex PCR (clfA, clfB, sdr and ssp genes).

The multiplex PCR mixture contains: primers for each of the genes to be amplified (the cflA, cflB, sdr, and ssp genes), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq polymerase), dNTPs, and the reaction buffer.

1.	Label your PCR tube carefully, including your bench number.

2.	Use a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.

3.	Keep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step.

PCR amplification for both reactions

Amplification of DNA fragments will be performed with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, and one minute at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes on a Bio-Rad DNA-Engine thermocycler. This PCR programme takes about 2½ hours to run.

Protocol 4.5: Make an agarose gel.

1.	Prepare a gel tray. Use tape to seal off the top and bottom ends. Insert the comb in the slots in the tray. Check with a demonstrator before proceeding.

2.	A 2% agarose solution has been made for you as follows: 2 g of agarose were added to a glass flask, and 100 ml 1X TAE buffer. The agarose solution was heated in a microwave till agarose is completely dissolved in the buffer, and then cooled down to about 50°C.

3.	Pour the agarose into your prepared gel tray and leave it to set.

Gel electrophoresis

After the thermocycler run has finished, your samples will be run on your gel for you as follows: we will add 5 µl of spa PCR product to the multiplex PCR products and then run 16 µl of the combined reaction on the 2% agarose gel. Bioline 100bp DNA ladder (BIO-33056) will be used for each of the gels. We will then take gel images with the “gel doc system” and post your data to the BM327 microbiology class sub-page.

You will need to observe the growth of your unknown and control strains on selective/differential media and record your results in Table 4.8. 



Protocol 4.6: Determining the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic

1.	Prepare a seed lawn for each of your three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate as follows: pipette 100 µl of the supplied culture onto the centre of a Mueller Hinton agar plate and use a sterile plastic spreader to distribute the culture evenly over the surface of the agar. The liquid should be completely absorbed into the agar before you add the antibiotic disks in step 5.

2.	Obtain an empty petri dish containing fifteen sterile filter discs.

3.	In four sterile 1.5 ml tubes, prepare dilutions of the supplied solution of gentamicin (1 mg/ml). You will be adding 20 µl of each dilution to a filter disk, but it is always a good idea to prepare a slightly larger volume to account for any pipetting errors - e.g. prepare 25 µl for each filter disk. Prepare the dilutions so that you will end up with 4 µg, 8 µg, 12 µg and 16 µg of gentamicin when you add 20 µl of the dilution to a filter disk.

Equation:	C1 x V1 = C2 x V2	[C, concentration; V, volume]

Example:	4 µg/20 µl x 25 µl = 1 mg/ml x ???

Using this equation, complete the following table and then prepare the dilutions:

# Aim

To understand how to examine microorganisms, both at the macroscopic (colony morphology), and the microscopic (including the use of appropriate staining techniques) scale.

# Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

*	How to identify microorganisms from their macroscopic characteristics.

*	How to identify microorganisms from their microscopic characteristics.

*	How to use differential media to identify bacterial species.

Competencies are action-oriented statements of the knowledge, skills, and abilities people need to do their work successfully. They are observable and measurable. These are what you need to do the job and work in their organisation. Some are straightforward and required in many different career: communication, teamwork and problem solving are just a few. You need to show employers you have mastered essential skills such as writing, reading, numeracy, presentation, organisation and the ability to work under pressure. Graduates who demonstrate their analytical thinking during a job interview or assessment centre will stand out from other candidates. Other skills such as those gained in the laboratory are more specific and aligned to particular types of jobs e.g. ability to do a PCR.\nYou will be assessed for your competency in the following:\nLab 1\nLab 2\nLab 3\nLab 4\nLab 5",

    "text": "6.1.1 Some guidelines for keeping a good lab notebook:\n\nYour notebook may be kept in the form of a physical notebook (kept on paper) or an electronic notebook. The former should be written in clearly and legibly, using indelible ink. The latter should be saved often, with backup copies stored securely.\nInclude the date for each entry.\nEach experiment should include a title, a hypothesis or aim, a brief description of the background, protocols and details of any reagents/equipment used, observations, and any data or statistical analysis that was performed.\nAny protocols or methods should be described in enough detail that a colleague (or you in six months’ time!) can repeat the same experiment, starting from the same dataset/materials, and reach the same results.\nAny mistakes should be crossed out and explained (not erased).\nAll data should always be recorded in your lab notebook (even “failed” experiments or “outliers”).\n\nOne popular and widely used electronic lab notebook is Benchling.\n\nYou can join Benchling by creating an account at http://benchling.com/signup\nFor help with Benchling, including training kits and best practice guides, please see https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Good Labelling Technique\nIt is essential that all tubes and plates be clearly and legibly labelled. You will often be working with these over a period of several weeks, and you will be unable to interpret/analyse the results from a previous week’s experiments if you have not labelled your samples correctly.\nSome general guidelines for good labelling practice:\n\nInclude your initials and the date of the experiment (if directed by your instructors, also include your bench number).\nIf working with microorganisms, always include the species name (abbreviations, e.g. E. coli are fine)\nIf labelling Petri plates, label around the outside rim of the plate (do not obscure the plate as it will make it hard to count colonies!) and be sure to label the bottom of the plate (the bottom and lid may become separated, so labelling the lid is a bad idea.)\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Other tips for good lab practice\n\nRead through each protocol thoroughly before beginning an experiment. Label all tubes and prepare any reagents needed. Stay organised and keep your space clean.\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not working aseptically.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\nPipet as accurately as possible:\nUse the correct pipet for the volume you intend to pipet and make sure it is set correctly (if uncertain, ask a demonstrator or member of staff)\nPipet down to the first stop when drawing up liquid into the pipet; pipet down to the second stop when expelling liquid.\nAvoid bubbles when pipetting.\nOnly insert the very tip of the pipet into the liquid when pipetting particularly viscous mixtures (e.g., polymerase or enzyme stocks).\nChange pipet tips between different samples.\nNever set a pipet down, or hold it horizontally/at an angle, with a pipet tip attached. It can damage a pipet if liquid comes up into the barrel.",

    "text": "Aseptic Technique\nIt is essential that you work aseptically when working in a microbiology lab. Microbes are ubiquitous in the environment (including in the air, and on your skin). It is essential that you work aseptically so that your experiment contains only the organism(s) you are working with, and not unwanted contaminants!\nMost of the materials you will be working with (pipet tips, microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) tubes, culture media, etc. will have been sterilised for you by autoclaving: the autoclave sterilises these items by subjecting them to pressurised steam (121C, 15 p.s.i.). You will be able to recognise that these items have been autoclaved based on the use of autoclave tape, which changes colour when subjected to high heat and pressure. It is essential that you use these sterilised items: do not take unsterilised pipet tips or microcentrifuge tubes from the shelves.\nOne of the cornerstone principles of aseptic technique is that any objects, even those that have previously been sterile, can no longer be considered sterile if they come into contact with non-sterile objects. Be careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).\nIn order to keep your work sterile and free from contamination that could interfere with your experiments, you should work near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame. The Bunsen creates an updraft of air, helping to maintain a “clean” zone around it. Having the Bunsen burner lit, but working several meters away from this clean zone, is ineffective and will likely result in contamination of your experiments.\nWhen working with a Bunsen burner, however, it is essential that you follow the following safety guidelines, for the safety of yourself and those working near you:\n\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not actively using it.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\n\nYou should use good aseptic technique when working with all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.), to prevent the contents from becoming contaminated. Containers should be opened for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample. Tip boxes should not be left open.\nSome tips on working with good aseptic technique:\n\nWork near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame (the Bunsen creates an updraft of air, helping to maintain a “clean” zone around it.\nOpen all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.) for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample. Tip boxes should not be left open.\nBe sure to flame your inoculating loop thoroughly, both before touching it to a sample and before putting it down. The procedure for flaming your loop is:\n\n\nPlace the loop in the flame of the Bunsen burner at an angle, so that the length of the loop lies along the surface between the inner and outer cones in the flame (the hottest part of the flame).\nHold the loop in the flame until the entirety of the loop turns cherry-red. It is not necessary to hold the loop there any longer than that: you are not trying to melt the metal!\nRemove the loop from the flame and allow it to cool, either by holding it in the air for several seconds (in the aseptic working zone near the Bunsen burner), or by touching it to a sterile surface (i.e. the inside of a culture tube or the agar in an uninoculated Petri dish.)\n\n\nBe careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).",

    "text": "Correct use of a microscope\nBacteria are much smaller than anything else you will have looked at under a microscope; most bacterial cells are approximately 1-3 m long. Optimal set up of the microscope is therefore essential.\nPlease note that you should not wear gloves while working with ta microscope: you do not want to inadvertently transfer staining reagents onto it.\nBegin by placing a slide onto the stage and aligning the lowest power objective (usually the 10X objective) over it. 1. Raise the stage using the coarse focusing knob so that the slide is about 5 mm away from the objective. 2. Bring the slide into focus as best you can, first using the coarse focusing knob and then the fine focusing knob. You will be slowly lowering the stage so as to increase the distance between the slide and objective. 3. Once you have focussed as best you can using this objective, you should move on to the next highest power objective.\nOften the plane of focus is extremely narrow, so that small, faint objects like stained bacteria may be easily missed as the focus passes through the plane. Thus, a good technique is to constantly move the focus up and down while also slowly moving the slide up/down or left/right on the stage. In this way, objects that flash in and out of focus tend to be more easily noticed by the eye.\nAt any point while using the microscope, you may wish to:  Adjust the “interocular separation” of the eyepieces so that they are comfortably aligned with your eyes.  Adjust the lamp voltage at any time when using a microscope in order to get a comfortable level of light.\nUse of oil with the microscope:  The 100x objective is designed to be used with oil (it will have “oil” explicitly written on it), whereas the other objectives are not.  Never use oil with any objective other than the 100x. Once you have added oil to your sample, never return to using a smaller magnification objective!  Only a very small amount of oil is needed, only add a tiny drop. Don’t flood the slide!  When you have found your focus and optimised set-up with the 40x objective, swing the objectives half-way between the 40x and 100x. DO NOT move the stage or change the focus as you do this! The gently add a very small drop of oil onto the spot of light you can see in your sample. Gently swing the 100x objective into place.  You will most likely have to adjust the focus a little, but only use the fine adjustment at this stage. Ask for help if you have trouble finding the focus. Under no circumstances go back to the 40x, as it does not tolerate getting in contact to the immersion oil.  Residual oil will cling to the 100X objective after use, so make sure you clean it off with a lens tissue (specifically designed for this purpose) before putting the objective away. DO NOT use any other tissue to clean the lens.",

    "text": "14.1 Choice of media and growth conditions\nThe techniques used to identify microbes can broadly be divided into molecular or culture based techniques. Molecular techniques rely on the identification of microbial macromolecules (usually DNA or proteins): examples include whole-genome sequencing, detection of specific sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and proteomic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS). Culture-based techniques use differential stains, such as the Gram stain, selective and differential media, and biochemical tests to identify organisms based on their phenotypes.\nMost naturally occurring microorganisms exist in mixed populations, whether this is in a particular environment or in the context of a human host (e.g., when causing disease). Environmental and clinical samples must therefore be grown on solid media so that different microorganisms can form distinct colonies for isolation and identification.\nAlthough microbiologists often work with pure cultures in the laboratory, and it can be simpler to study a single organism grown in pure culture, we are beginning to realise the importance of complex microbial communities and have begun to utilise co-cultures to study these communities in the lab. However, being able to work with pure cultures is an essential technique for any microbiologist, and is useful in many other disciplines as well (e.g., for any experimenter who wishes to clone or manipulate genes in their model organism; for the production and purification of proteins for structural or biochemical analysis; etc.)\nThe first step in identification of a pathogen is isolating that pathogen in pure culture. In clinical microbiology, we very often begin with a Gram stain (Figure 5) and use a dichotomous key (Figure 6) to identify organisms based on their phenotypes (e.g., ability to grow on particular media, phenotype(s) in certain biochemical test(s), etc.). The Gram stain allows us to characterize bacteria based on the structure of their cell walls, and moreover, observing the cells under the microscope and noting their shape and arrangement (Figure 7) can help to narrow down a preliminary identification.\nCareful selection of growth media is necessary when working with microbes in the lab, as different microbes often require very different growth conditions. Researchers must provide microbes with supportive conditions for growth (Figure 8). All of the nutrients required for the cells to produce energy and the building blocks required for the synthesis of biological macromolecules and cell growth and division must be present (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, etc.). In addition, researchers must take care to ensure that the physical environment supports the growth of the microbe they are trying to culture (e.g., pH, oxygen, temperature, etc.) Most of the human pathogens that you will encounter in this course grow well at 37˚C (human body temperature), and are able to grow well in the presence of oxygen. However, a number of clinically important microbes are anaerobic and grow only in anoxic conditions.\nMicrobial growth media can be categorized in different ways: based on their composition (rich/complex or defined media) or based on their function (selective or differential). Rich growth media provide all the essential nutrients required for the growth of a wide range of microorganisms. They contain complex ingredients like peptones, extracts, and sugars, which support the growth of various organisms without specific nutritional requirements. On the other hand, defined growth media have precisely known compositions, with each component specified in exact quantities. They are used to study the nutritional requirements of specific microorganisms, to control the growth conditions precisely, to study an organism’s metabolism, and in studies of auxotrophic mutants.\nSelective media are designed to encourage the growth of specific groups of microorganisms while inhibiting the growth of others. They contain substances such as antibiotics, dyes, or inhibitors that selectively suppress the growth of certain microorganisms, allowing the desired ones to grow. Differential media, on the other hand, contain indicators, such as dyes or pH indicators, that allow different microorganisms to be visually distinguished based on their metabolic activities. These media exploit the ability of certain bacteria to produce specific enzymes or metabolize specific substrates, leading to observable changes in the appearance of the medium. Some media, including the Mannitol Salt Agar (Figure 9) and MacConkey/lactose agar (Figure 10) that we will be using in this experiment, are both differential and selective.\nWe can take advantage of the inability of certain microbes to grow in specific conditions in our efforts to identify them (e.g., using their phenotypes in a dichotomous key). Clinical microbiologists have developed a number of different media that are useful for the identification of unknown microorganisms. Overall, the choice of growth media for a particular experiment will depend on the organism(s) being cultivated and the specific objectives of the experiment.",

    "text": "14.2 Identification of microorganisms by microscopic characterisation\nThe individual cells of typical bacteria are very small. To be seen clearly, they must be fixed to a glass slide, stained, and then examined using a microscope fitted with an oil-immersion lens (x100) which is capable of producing an overall magnification of at least x1000. The most common staining technique employed in microbiology is the Gram stain since it allows visualisation of the test bacterium under a light microscope and it is a discriminatory stain (i.e. it contributes to the identification of a microorganism, particularly when the information provided is used in conjunction with the macroscopic characteristics).\nMoulds are multicellular fungi. They are much larger than yeasts and they do not require the use of an oil-immersion lens to be seen clearly. The characteristics of their mycelia may be seen using the microscope’s low power objective lens (x10); the characteristics of their hyphae, conidiophores and spores may be seen using the high power lens (x40). Although no stains are required to visualise the sample, simple stains such as iodine solution or lactophenol cotton blue reagent are sometimes applied to highlight cellular morphology more clearly.\n\n14.2.1 Identification of microbes using selective and differential media\nMacroscopic observations of bacterial colony morphology can be useful in the identification of different species, as you saw in Task 2A. In addition to examining bacteria grown on nutrient agar, you will also find a wide range of differential and selective media used in clinical microbiology. These use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. Selective media allow the growth of some bacteria, but not others. Differential media exploit specific chemical products of metabolism to produce visual indications of their production (e.g. by changes in colour of the colony or growth media), which can then be used to help identify the producing organism. Some media may be both selective and differential; and, in some cases, you may need to use multiple selective/differential media in combination to correctly identify an unknown organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study 1\n\n\n\n14.3 CASE STUDY 1: Strep throat?\nPatient history: young child with a sore throat, mild fever, swollen lymph nodes, no history of previous Strep throat.\nThe clinician suspects that the child may have a Group A Strep (Streptococcus pyogenes) infection. However, many sore throats are caused by viruses instead. Before starting the child on a course of antibiotics, the clinician takes a throat swab culture and sends it to the lab for analysis.\nGram staining and microscopic observation showed the presence of a Gram-positive coccus-shaped bacterium. Your task is to identify the bacterial species causing this infection (Task 2C).\nDifferential media - use of blood agar to differentiate bacteria based on their haemolytic activity\nBlood agar plates are a differential medium used to detect haemolytic activity in different microorganisms. They are also useful for the clinical microbiologist, as this medium is enriched with mammalian blood and thus supports the growth of many nutritionally fastidious organisms. Several pathogenic bacteria can produce a haemolysin capable of lysing red blood cells, and thus a zone of lysed cells appears around these bacteria when they are grown on blood agar plates. This diagnostic test is particularly useful for the identification of Streptococcal sp.\nThere are three types of haemolysis as illustrated in Figure 2.4. Beta haemolysis is complete haemolysis: the blood cells are lysed and a clear zone forms around the colony. In alpha haemolysis (sometimes called incomplete haemolysis), the blood cells are not actually lysed; instead, the haemoglobin is reduced to methaemoglobin, causing a greenish or brownish discoloration. Gamma haemolysis is the lack of haemolysis, with no change to the surrounding medium after bacterial growth. Note that some bacteria may produce more than one more haemolysin, and also some haemolysins are oxygen-sensitive and only function in anaerobic conditions).\nYou will be given an unknown Streptococcus sp. to identify based on its haemolytic activity, as well as a set of controls (strains with known alpha, beta, and gamma haemolytic activities).",

Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. In this laboratory session, you will be identifying a pathogen of the skin and circulatory system, Staphylococcus aureus, using differential media (TASK 4A), biochemical assays (TASK 4B), and a PCR-based technique called MVLA typing (TASK 4C).\nStaphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are both members of the normal human skin flora (commensals), and dangerous pathogens often associated with nosocomial infections. Although Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis appear very similar when examined under the microscope (as in the Gram-staining procedure you carried out in laboratory session 1), they can be distinguished from one another on the basis of several different phenotypic characteristics (Table 14).\nCASE STUDY 5: Epidemiology of an MRSA outbreak\nA number of patients at the local hospital have been acquiring secondary infections after seeing Dr. X for routine medical procedures. However, many of the patients also move in the same social circles, and so it is not clear whether these infections are nosocomial or community-acquired.\nAs a consulting microbiologist from the NHS, you have been asked to help the hospital discover the source of the pathogens, so that they can clean up their protocols for infection control if necessary. The first step is to determine whether the bacteria isolated from the patients are all genetically identical (from the same source) or different (from different sources).\nYou have already streaked your unknown organism on a selective and differential medium (MSA); you will now observe these plates and interpret the results (TASK 4A).\nYour goal is to identify the strains involved in the outbreak. You suspect that it is MRSA, but you must first confirm this. We have already determined that the patient isolates are in fact Staphylococci using a lysostaphin test (Appendix 03); you will next determine whether they are Staphylococcus aureus or other Staphylococci using a diagnostic coagulase test (TASK 4B). Finally, you will further identify your Staphylococcus aureus isolate using MVLA typing (TASK 4C).\nIntroduction: MLVA typing\nadd intro hereeeeeee",

You have also been provided with cultures of type strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis grown on MSA agar as controls. Record your observations in Table 4.2.\nProtocol 4.2: Coagulase slide test.\n\nPlace a drop of sterile water on a glass slide.\nUsing a flamed loop, that has been allowed to cool, remove an isolated colony from the culture plate and gently emulsify on the slide with the drop of sterile water. \nPlace a drop of plasma immediately adjacent to the bacterial suspension and mix the two samples together.\nGently tilt the slide back and forwards, observing for the immediate formation of a white precipitate.\n\nInterpretation\nA positive reaction (formation of white precipitate) is typically detected 15 – 20 seconds. The test is considered negative if clumping is not observed within 2 – 3 minutes.\nSetting up PCR reaction mixtures\n• Work on ice. • Pipet carefully and accurately. • Watch what you touch – you are covered with nucleases and your own Staphylococcus aureus! • Stay organized – keep track of what you have added to your reaction and what still needs to be added. • Label your tubes – there will be 96 on the thermocycler altogether!\nProtocol 4.3: Set up single PCR (spa gene).\nThe spa gene must be amplified separately as these primers do not perform well in the multiplex PCR reaction. The single PCR mixture contains: primers for the gene to be amplified (the spa gene), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq), dNTPs, the reaction buffer, and PCR-grade water.\n\nLabel your PCR tube carefully with the gene name (spa) and your bench number.\nUse a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.\nKeep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step (thermocycler).\n\nProtocol 4.4: Set up multiplex PCR (clfA, clfB, sdr and ssp genes).\nThe multiplex PCR mixture contains: primers for each of the genes to be amplified (the cflA, cflB, sdr, and ssp genes), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq polymerase), dNTPs, and the reaction buffer.\n\nLabel your PCR tube carefully, including your bench number.\nUse a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.\nKeep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step.\n\nPCR amplification for both reactions\nAmplification of DNA fragments will be performed with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, and one minute at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes on a Bio-Rad DNA-Engine thermocycler. This PCR programme takes about 2½ hours to run.\nProtocol 4.5: Make an agarose gel.\n\nPrepare a gel tray. Use tape to seal off the top and bottom ends. Insert the comb in the slots in the tray. Check with a demonstrator before proceeding.\nA 2% agarose solution has been made for you as follows: 2 g of agarose were added to a glass flask, and 100 ml 1X TAE buffer. The agarose solution was heated in a microwave till agarose is completely dissolved in the buffer, and then cooled down to about 50°C.\nPour the agarose into your prepared gel tray and leave it to set.\n\nGel electrophoresis\nAfter the thermocycler run has finished, your samples will be run on your gel for you as follows: we will add 5 µl of spa PCR product to the multiplex PCR products and then run 16 µl of the combined reaction on the 2% agarose gel. Bioline 100bp DNA ladder (BIO-33056) will be used for each of the gels. We will then take gel images with the “gel doc system” and post your data to the BM327 microbiology class sub-page.\nYou will need to observe the growth of your unknown and control strains on selective/differential media and record your results in Table 4.8.\nProtocol 4.6: Determining the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic\n\nPrepare a seed lawn for each of your three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate as follows: pipette 100 µl of the supplied culture onto the centre of a Mueller Hinton agar plate and use a sterile plastic spreader to distribute the culture evenly over the surface of the agar. The liquid should be completely absorbed into the agar before you add the antibiotic disks in step 5.\nObtain an empty petri dish containing fifteen sterile filter discs.\nIn four sterile 1.5 ml tubes, prepare dilutions of the supplied solution of gentamicin (1 mg/ml). You will be adding 20 µl of each dilution to a filter disk, but it is always a good idea to prepare a slightly larger volume to account for any pipetting errors - e.g. prepare 25 µl for each filter disk. Prepare the dilutions so that you will end up with 4 µg, 8 µg, 12 µg and 16 µg of gentamicin when you add 20 µl of the dilution to a filter disk.\n\nEquation: C1 x V1 = C2 x V2 [C, concentration; V, volume]\nExample: 4 µg/20 µl x 25 µl = 1 mg/ml x ???\nUsing this equation, complete the following table and then prepare the dilutions:\nTable 4.11: Calculation of antibiotic dilutions",

Bacteria in biofilms are often more resistant to killing by antibiotics. Biofilm formation is a complex, regulated process that begins with the initial attachment of bacteria to a surface, often mediated by flagella, pili, or other surface proteins on the bacterial cell (Figure 10). This surface attachment is what you will measure using a crystal violet stain that binds to the bacteria.\nFigure 12. Biofilm formation by Pseudomonas.\n  You will be provided with a tube of medium, and three liquid cultures of Pseudomonas which have been grown overnight in that same medium. You will test whether these Pseudomonas sp. are able to form biofilms using a crystal violet assay.\nCrystal violet will stain the bacteria but not the plastic. Therefore, attachment will be observed by the presence of a purple ring (Figure 11). This purple ring is made up of bacteria that have attached to the surface at the liquid-air interface.\nFigure 13. Biofilm formation measured using a crystal violet stain. Biofilm formation can be scored qualitatively e.g. +++: strong, ++: moderate, +: weak, 0: no formation.",

The patient is immunocompromised and has recently travelled extensively outside the UK.\nThe patient is positive for the Tb skin test, but has had the BCG vaccine and so this may be a false positive. The clinician suspects that it may in fact be an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and takes a sputum sample and sends it to the lab for analysis. The sample was plated on Löwenstein–Jensen medium and colonies were then isolated into pure culture.\nYour task is to identify the bacterial species causing this infection (Task 2C).\nTASK 5C: Using differential stain to identify a respiratory tract pathogen\nCertain microorganisms, in particular mycobacteria, have the power to retain specific stains even when they are decolourised by mineral acids. They are therefore referred to as being “acid-fast”. The ability of mycobacteria to resist decolourisation is due to the presence of high amounts of mycolic acid within their cell wall structure. Therefore, you can use this stain to determine whether the infectious agent in this case is a mycobacterium or not. You should carry out the staining procedure on positive and negative controls (acid-fast and non-acid-fast bacteria) as well as on your unknown.\nProtocol 5.2: Modified Ziehl-Neelson stain.\n\nHold a glass slide with metal forceps and flame thoroughly its operational upper surface using a Bunsen flame. Allow the slide to cool. Flame a loop until red hot and leave it to cool. Place a loopful of sterile water on the upper surface of the slide. Flame the loop again and allow it to cool, then use it to pick up a speck of a colony from the culture provided. Mix this speck thoroughly into the drop of water to form a dilute milky suspension covering an area of about the size of a 20p coin.\nAllow the film to dry completely. You may need to do this by warming the slide gently, holding it in forceps well above the Bunsen’s flame.\nFix the film of cells to the slide by passing the lower surface of the slide through the Bunsen flame slowly twice. The slide will now be hot to the touch; allow it to cool.\nPlace the slide on the staining rack over the sink.\nCover the slide with carbol fuchsin solution (this contains phenol, so take care to avoid contact with skin. Wash hands immediately if this happens). Allow to stand for 5 min.\nRinse with water.\n\nTake great care, wear protective gloves and safety spectacles now to handle the next solution (hydrochloric acid in ethanol) which is corrosive!\n\nDecolourise the slide by covering it with hydrochloric acid in ethanol solution, and allow to stand for 15 - 30 seconds.\nImmediately remove excess acid by running slide in tap water.\nCounterstain with malachite green solution for one minute.\nRemove excess stain with water.\nGently blot dry and examine with the oil-immersion lens (x100).",

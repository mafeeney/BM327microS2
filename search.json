It is just as important to keep a lab notebook for experiments performed in silico as it is for experiments performed at the lab bench.\nYou should be able to come back to your notebook six months later, read your notes, and be able to recreate the experiment/understand the analyses that you performed. Human memory is fallible and it is important to keep clear, accurate records.\nMoreover, an appropriately kept lab notebook is a legal document, important for protecting your intellectual property.

    "text": "2.1.1 Some guidelines for keeping a good lab notebook:\n\nYour notebook may be kept in the form of a physical notebook (kept on paper) or an electronic notebook. The former should be written in clearly and legibly, using indelible ink. The latter should be saved often, with backup copies stored securely.\nInclude the date for each entry.\nEach experiment should include a title, a hypothesis or aim, a brief description of the background, protocols and details of any reagents/equipment used, observations, and any data or statistical analysis that was performed.\nAny protocols or methods should be described in enough detail that a colleague (or you in six months’ time!) can repeat the same experiment, starting from the same dataset/materials, and reach the same results.\nAny mistakes should be crossed out and explained (not erased).\nAll data should always be recorded in your lab notebook (even “failed” experiments or “outliers”).\n\nOne popular and widely used electronic lab notebook is Benchling.\n\nYou can join Benchling by creating an account at http://benchling.com/signup\nFor help with Benchling, including training kits and best practice guides, please see https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Good Labelling Technique\nIt is essential that all tubes and plates be clearly and legibly labelled. You will often be working with these over a period of several weeks, and you will be unable to interpret/analyse the results from a previous week’s experiments if you have not labelled your samples correctly.\nSome general guidelines for good labelling practice:\n\nInclude your initials and the date of the experiment (if directed by your instructors, also include your bench number).\nIf working with microorganisms, always include the species name (abbreviations, e.g. E. coli are fine)\nIf labelling Petri plates, label around the outside rim of the plate (do not obscure the plate as it will make it hard to count colonies!) and be sure to label the bottom of the plate (the bottom and lid may become separated, so labelling the lid is a bad idea.)\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Other tips for good lab practice\n\nRead through each protocol thoroughly before beginning an experiment. Label all tubes and prepare any reagents needed. Stay organised and keep your space clean.\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not working aseptically.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\nPipet as accurately as possible:\nUse the correct pipet for the volume you intend to pipet and make sure it is set correctly (if uncertain, ask a demonstrator or member of staff)\nPipet down to the first stop when drawing up liquid into the pipet; pipet down to the second stop when expelling liquid.\nAvoid bubbles when pipetting.\nOnly insert the very tip of the pipet into the liquid when pipetting particularly viscous mixtures (e.g., polymerase or enzyme stocks).\nChange pipet tips between different samples.\nNever set a pipet down, or hold it horizontally/at an angle, with a pipet tip attached. It can damage a pipet if liquid comes up into the barrel.",

    "text": "Aseptic Technique\nIt is essential that you work aseptically when working in a microbiology lab. Microbes are ubiquitous in the environment (including in the air, and on your skin). It is essential that you work aseptically so that your experiment contains only the organism(s) you are working with, and not unwanted contaminants!\nMost of the materials you will be working with (pipet tips, microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) tubes, culture media, etc. will have been sterilised for you by autoclaving: the autoclave sterilises these items by subjecting them to pressurised steam (121C, 15 p.s.i.). You will be able to recognise that these items have been autoclaved based on the use of autoclave tape, which changes colour when subjected to high heat and pressure. It is essential that you use these sterilised items: do not take unsterilised pipet tips or microcentrifuge tubes from the shelves.\nOne of the cornerstone principles of aseptic technique is that any objects, even those that have previously been sterile, can no longer be considered sterile if they come into contact with non-sterile objects. Be careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).\nIn order to keep your work sterile and free from contamination that could interfere with your experiments, you should work near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame. The Bunsen creates an updraft of air, helping to maintain a “clean” zone around it. Having the Bunsen burner lit, but working several meters away from this clean zone, is ineffective and will likely result in contamination of your experiments.\nWhen working with a Bunsen burner, however, it is essential that you follow the following safety guidelines, for the safety of yourself and those working near you:\n\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not actively using it.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\n\nYou should use good aseptic technique when working with all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.), to prevent the contents from becoming contaminated. Containers should be opened for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample. Tip boxes should not be left open.\nSome tips on working with good aseptic technique:\n\nWork near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame (the Bunsen creates an updraft of air, helping to maintain a “clean” zone around it.\nOpen all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.) for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample. Tip boxes should not be left open.\nBe sure to flame your inoculating loop thoroughly, both before touching it to a sample and before putting it down. The procedure for flaming your loop is:\n\n\nPlace the loop in the flame of the Bunsen burner at an angle, so that the length of the loop lies along the surface between the inner and outer cones in the flame (the hottest part of the flame).\nHold the loop in the flame until the entirety of the loop turns cherry-red. It is not necessary to hold the loop there any longer than that: you are not trying to melt the metal!\nRemove the loop from the flame and allow it to cool, either by holding it in the air for several seconds (in the aseptic working zone near the Bunsen burner), or by touching it to a sterile surface (i.e. the inside of a culture tube or the agar in an uninoculated Petri dish.)\n\n\nBe careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).",

    "text": "Correct use of a microscope\nBacteria are much smaller than anything else you will have looked at under a microscope; most bacterial cells are approximately 1-3 m long. Optimal set up of the microscope is therefore essential.\nPlease note that you should not wear gloves while working with ta microscope: you do not want to inadvertently transfer staining reagents onto it.\nBegin by placing a slide onto the stage and aligning the lowest power objective (usually the 10X objective) over it. 1. Raise the stage using the coarse focusing knob so that the slide is about 5 mm away from the objective. 2. Bring the slide into focus as best you can, first using the coarse focusing knob and then the fine focusing knob. You will be slowly lowering the stage so as to increase the distance between the slide and objective. 3. Once you have focussed as best you can using this objective, you should move on to the next highest power objective.\nOften the plane of focus is extremely narrow, so that small, faint objects like stained bacteria may be easily missed as the focus passes through the plane. Thus, a good technique is to constantly move the focus up and down while also slowly moving the slide up/down or left/right on the stage. In this way, objects that flash in and out of focus tend to be more easily noticed by the eye.\nAt any point while using the microscope, you may wish to:  Adjust the “interocular separation” of the eyepieces so that they are comfortably aligned with your eyes.  Adjust the lamp voltage at any time when using a microscope in order to get a comfortable level of light.\nUse of oil with the microscope:  The 100x objective is designed to be used with oil (it will have “oil” explicitly written on it), whereas the other objectives are not.  Never use oil with any objective other than the 100x. Once you have added oil to your sample, never return to using a smaller magnification objective!  Only a very small amount of oil is needed, only add a tiny drop. Don’t flood the slide!  When you have found your focus and optimised set-up with the 40x objective, swing the objectives half-way between the 40x and 100x. DO NOT move the stage or change the focus as you do this! The gently add a very small drop of oil onto the spot of light you can see in your sample. Gently swing the 100x objective into place.  You will most likely have to adjust the focus a little, but only use the fine adjustment at this stage. Ask for help if you have trouble finding the focus. Under no circumstances go back to the 40x, as it does not tolerate getting in contact to the immersion oil.  Residual oil will cling to the 100X objective after use, so make sure you clean it off with a lens tissue (specifically designed for this purpose) before putting the objective away. DO NOT use any other tissue to clean the lens.",

    "text": "Microbial Identification\nThe techniques used to identify microbes can broadly be divided into molecular or culture based techniques. Molecular techniques rely on the identification of microbial macromolecules (usually DNA or proteins): examples include whole-genome sequencing, detection of specific sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and proteomic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS). Culture-based techniques use differential stains, such as the Gram stain, selective and differential media, and biochemical tests to identify organisms based on their phenotypes.\nMost naturally occurring microorganisms exist in mixed populations, whether this is in a particular environment or in the context of a human host (e.g., when causing disease). Environmental and clinical samples must therefore be grown on solid media so that different microorganisms can form distinct colonies for isolation and identification.\nAlthough microbiologists often work with pure cultures in the laboratory, and it can be simpler to study a single organism grown in pure culture, we are beginning to realise the importance of complex microbial communities and have begun to utilise co-cultures to study these communities in the lab. However, being able to work with pure cultures is an essential technique for any microbiologist, and is useful in many other disciplines as well (e.g., for any experimenter who wishes to clone or manipulate genes in their model organism; for the production and purification of proteins for structural or biochemical analysis; etc.)\nThe first step in identification of a pathogen is isolating that pathogen in pure culture. In clinical microbiology, we very often begin with a Gram stain (Figure 5) and use a dichotomous key (Figure 6) to identify organisms based on their phenotypes (e.g., ability to grow on particular media, phenotype(s) in certain biochemical test(s), etc.). The Gram stain allows us to characterize bacteria based on the structure of their cell walls, and moreover, observing the cells under the microscope and noting their shape and arrangement (Figure 7) can help to narrow down a preliminary identification.\nChoice of media and growth conditions\nCareful selection of growth media is necessary when working with microbes in the lab, as different microbes often require very different growth conditions. Researchers must provide microbes with supportive conditions for growth (Figure 8). All of the nutrients required for the cells to produce energy and the building blocks required for the synthesis of biological macromolecules and cell growth and division must be present (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, etc.). In addition, researchers must take care to ensure that the physical environment supports the growth of the microbe they are trying to culture (e.g., pH, oxygen, temperature, etc.) Most of the human pathogens that you will encounter in this course grow well at 37˚C (human body temperature), and are able to grow well in the presence of oxygen. However, a number of clinically important microbes are anaerobic and grow only in anoxic conditions.\nMicrobial growth media can be categorized in different ways: based on their composition (rich/complex or defined media) or based on their function (selective or differential). Rich growth media provide all the essential nutrients required for the growth of a wide range of microorganisms. They contain complex ingredients like peptones, extracts, and sugars, which support the growth of various organisms without specific nutritional requirements. On the other hand, defined growth media have precisely known compositions, with each component specified in exact quantities. They are used to study the nutritional requirements of specific microorganisms, to control the growth conditions precisely, to study an organism’s metabolism, and in studies of auxotrophic mutants.\nSelective media are designed to encourage the growth of specific groups of microorganisms while inhibiting the growth of others. They contain substances such as antibiotics, dyes, or inhibitors that selectively suppress the growth of certain microorganisms, allowing the desired ones to grow. Differential media, on the other hand, contain indicators, such as dyes or pH indicators, that allow different microorganisms to be visually distinguished based on their metabolic activities. These media exploit the ability of certain bacteria to produce specific enzymes or metabolize specific substrates, leading to observable changes in the appearance of the medium. Some media, including the Mannitol Salt Agar (Figure 9) and MacConkey/lactose agar (Figure 10) that we will be using in this experiment, are both differential and selective.\nWe can take advantage of the inability of certain microbes to grow in specific conditions in our efforts to identify them (e.g., using their phenotypes in a dichotomous key). Clinical microbiologists have developed a number of different media that are useful for the identification of unknown microorganisms. Overall, the choice of growth media for a particular experiment will depend on the organism(s) being cultivated and the specific objectives of the experiment.\nIdentification of microorganisms by macroscopic characterisation\nTASK 2A: Observation of macroscopic characteristics\n\nBacterial colonies on solid media\n\nUnder certain culture conditions bacteria may show different characteristics of growth which might be useful in their description and identification. You are supplied with cultures of bacteria which have been grown on the surface of nutrient agar plates for 24 hours at 37ºC. Examine the colonies and record your description of the colonies in Table 2.1. Use of a hand lens will allow you to observe individual colonies in greater detail and a ruler will be useful in providing accurate colony size measurements.\nIdentification of microorganisms by microscopic characterisation\nTASK 2B: Observation of microscopic characteristics\nThe individual cells of typical bacteria are very small. To be seen clearly, they must be fixed to a glass slide, stained, and then examined using a microscope fitted with an oil-immersion lens (x100) which is capable of producing an overall magnification of at least x1000. The most common staining technique employed in microbiology is the Gram stain since it allows visualisation of the test bacterium under a light microscope and it is a discriminatory stain (i.e. it contributes to the identification of a microorganism, particularly when the information provided is used in conjunction with the macroscopic characteristics).\nMoulds are multicellular fungi. They are much larger than yeasts and they do not require the use of an oil-immersion lens to be seen clearly. The characteristics of their mycelia may be seen using the microscope’s low power objective lens (x10); the characteristics of their hyphae, conidiophores and spores may be seen using the high power lens (x40). Although no stains are required to visualise the sample, simple stains such as iodine solution or lactophenol cotton blue reagent are sometimes applied to highlight cellular morphology more clearly.\nIdentification of microbes using selective and differential media\nMacroscopic observations of bacterial colony morphology can be useful in the identification of different species, as you saw in Task 2A. In addition to examining bacteria grown on nutrient agar, you will also find a wide range of differential and selective media used in clinical microbiology. These use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. Selective media allow the growth of some bacteria, but not others. Differential media exploit specific chemical products of metabolism to produce visual indications of their production (e.g. by changes in colour of the colony or growth media), which can then be used to help identify the producing organism. Some media may be both selective and differential; and, in some cases, you may need to use multiple selective/differential media in combination to correctly identify an unknown organism.\nCASE STUDY 1: Strep throat?\nPatient history: young child with a sore throat, mild fever, swollen lymph nodes, no history of previous Strep throat.\nThe clinician suspects that the child may have a Group A Strep (Streptococcus pyogenes) infection. However, many sore throats are caused by viruses instead. Before starting the child on a course of antibiotics, the clinician takes a throat swab culture and sends it to the lab for analysis.\nGram staining and microscopic observation showed the presence of a Gram-positive coccus-shaped bacterium. Your task is to identify the bacterial species causing this infection (Task 2C).\nDifferential media - use of blood agar to differentiate bacteria based on their haemolytic activity\nBlood agar plates are a differential medium used to detect haemolytic activity in different microorganisms. They are also useful for the clinical microbiologist, as this medium is enriched with mammalian blood and thus supports the growth of many nutritionally fastidious organisms. Several pathogenic bacteria can produce a haemolysin capable of lysing red blood cells, and thus a zone of lysed cells appears around these bacteria when they are grown on blood agar plates. This diagnostic test is particularly useful for the identification of Streptococcal sp.\nThere are three types of haemolysis as illustrated in Figure 2.4. Beta haemolysis is complete haemolysis: the blood cells are lysed and a clear zone forms around the colony. In alpha haemolysis (sometimes called incomplete haemolysis), the blood cells are not actually lysed; instead, the haemoglobin is reduced to methaemoglobin, causing a greenish or brownish discoloration. Gamma haemolysis is the lack of haemolysis, with no change to the surrounding medium after bacterial growth. Note that some bacteria may produce more than one more haemolysin, and also some haemolysins are oxygen-sensitive and only function in anaerobic conditions).\nYou will be given an unknown Streptococcus sp. to identify based on its haemolytic activity, as well as a set of controls (strains with known alpha, beta, and gamma haemolytic activities).",

    "text": "Protocol 2.1: Observation of bacterial colony morphology.\n\nMeasure the diameter of a representative colony in millimetres.\nDescribe the pigmentation (distinguishing between pigmented colonies and those secreting diffusible pigments) and record in Table 2.1.\nDescribe the form, elevation, and margin of a representative colony (using the correct terminology as indicated in Figure 2.1). Also indicate whether the colonies are smooth (shiny glistening surface), rough (dull, bumpy, granular, or matte surface), or mucoid (slimy or gummy appearance) and record in Table 2.1.\nRecord the opacity of the colonies (transparent, translucent, or opaque) in Table 2.1.\nFungal colonies on solid media\n\nYou are supplied with a culture of a yeast (unicellular fungus) and moulds (multicellular fungi) that has been grown on the surface of Sabouraud/dextrose agar plates for 72 hours at 25°C. Examine the colonies and record your descriptions in Table 1.2.\n\nGram stain of bacterial colonies isolated from solid media\n\nProtocol 2.2: Preparing Gram-stained bacterial cells.\nPlease note, it is advisable that you wear safety gloves when handling staining reagents. However, gloves must be removed when working near the Bunsen burner.\n\nHold a glass slide with metal forceps and flame thoroughly its upper surface using a Bunsen flame (this degreases the slide and allows even spreading of the film of bacterial cells). Allow the slide to cool.\nFlame a loop until red hot and leave it to cool (hold steady, do not move around or lay it on the bench). Once cool, place a loopful of sterile water on the upper surface of the slide (use half the slide – step 3. tells you that you can fit two samples onto a slide). Flame the loop again and allow it to cool, then use it to pick up a speck of a bacterial colony (ideally this would be one bacterial colony). Mix this speck thoroughly into the drop of water to form a dilute milky suspension covering an area of about the size of a 20p coin (the aim is to provide a film that contains a single layer of cells. Too high a density of cells applied to the slide results in loss of detail as the cells are too closely packed together. The amount of culture necessary to produce a good film is learned from experience).\nYou can fit two samples onto a slide – repeat step 2 for a second culture, making sure that the two samples are well-separated. If labelling the samples on a slide using a permanent marker, use caution to ensure that the label is not destroyed during the ethanol wash.\nDry the film completely by warming the slide gently. Hold the slide well above the Bunsen flame.\nFix the film of cells to the slide by passing the lower surface of the slide through the Bunsen flame slowly twice. Allow the slide to cool.\nStain the film with 0.5% w/v crystal violet for 30 seconds.\nDrain the crystal violet, rinse off the remainder with a solution of iodine (1% w/v iodine in 2% w/v potassium iodide). Cover the film with iodine for one minute.\nDrain the iodine, rinse off the remainder with alcohol. Rock the alcohol from side to side until no more crystal violet is removed. This process should take no longer than 45 seconds.\nDrain off the alcohol remaining and gently blot the slide dry.\nRinse with water.\nCover the film with 1% w/v safranin for 30 seconds. Wash the safranin off the slide with water and allow the slide to dry.\n\nInterpretation\nGram-positive organisms are stained blue/violet. Gram-negative organisms are stained red/pink.\nUsing the Gram-staining technique detailed above, prepare stained films of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Observe your slides under the microscope, using a low power objective lens (x10) first and then the oil-immersion lens (x100).\nIndicate whether the organism is Gram-positive or Gram-negative and make accurate drawings of the cells of the five bacteria to show clearly the shapes of the individual cells, and the groupings of the individual cells (Table 2.3).\nProtocol 2.3: Microscopic examination of fungi.\n\nPlace a drop of iodine solution on the surface of a glass slide.\nUsing a flamed and cooled loop, pick up a small amount of a colony of a fungus and tease it out in the drop of iodine.\nPlace a cover slip on top of the mounted material and examine the fungi using first the low power (x10) and then the high power (x40) objective lenses of the microscope. Make accurate drawings of the three fungi showing their mycelia, hyphal structure (whether septate or non-septate), conidiophores and spores (Table 2.4).\n\nProtocol 2.4: Streaking for single colonies.\n\nFlame a loop, let it cool slightly and then touch it to the bacterial colony you have chosen to streak on a new plate.\nPick up the bottom of the new plate (leaving the lid on the bench) with your other hand, turn it over and gently streak the loop back and forth over a small area of the plate. Use light pressure so you don’t gouge the agar.\nReturn the plate to its lid so as to protect it from contaminants in the air while you re-flame the loop. Allow the loop to cool.\nPick up the plate again and touch the cooled loop onto an area of the agar that has not previously been streaked. (This step helps to quench the heat from the loop and so prevents it from killing any bacteria it subsequently comes into contact with.)\nDrag the loop once through the previous streaked area and streak it out across a new area of agar. As the loop drags across the previous streak it will pick up some bacteria and distribute them across the new area of agar.\nRepeat steps 4 - 5 two or three times as necessary to cover the entire surface of the plate (See Figure 2.5).\nMake sure that all agar plates are clearly labelled with your name, the sample name or number, your bench number, and the date. You should label the bottom of the plate (not the top – which may become separated from the bottom!). It is best to write in a circle around the edge of the plate, so that your writing will not obscure observation of the growth on the plate.\nYou will record your results in Table 2.4 during laboratory session 2 (Task 2D).",

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them.\nIn this laboratory session, you will be identifying pathogens of the intestinal tract (Case study 5) using differential and selective media (Task 3A), and an API-20E set of biochemical tests (Task 3B). In Case study 6, you will be looking at some of the enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism using biochemical assays (Task 3C), and at the ability of microbes to grow aerobically or anaerobically (Task 3D).\nCASE STUDY 5: The case of the contaminated spinach\nThe epidemiologists have linked a sudden outbreak of diaorrheal diseases to a particular batch of frozen spinach, but the aetiological agent has not yet been confirmed.\nYou are working as a microbiologist with the Food Standards Agency, which is looking into the case. You suspect that it may be one of the common culprits – E. coli, Salmonella, or Shigella – but you need to figure out which.\nA small portion of the spinach was homogenized and plated out on non-selective nutrient agar, and isolated colonies then grown in pure culture.\nYour task is to determine whether the isolated pathogen is E. coli, Salmonella, or Shigella using selective and differential media (Task 3A) and an API-20E strip test (Task 3B).\nPathogenic enterobacteriaceae like Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli are all relatively closely related, and they share a number of common characteristics – they are Gram-negative rods, non-spore-forming, facultative aerobes. However, they can be distinguished from one another by molecular methods or based on a number of biochemical tests, as can be seen in Table 3.1.\nTASK 3A: Using selective and differential media for the cultivation and identification of Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella sp.\nMacConkey agar\nMacConkey agar is a selective differential medium that is used for primary isolation of Enterobacteriaceae and related enteric Gram-negative bacilli and to aid in the identification of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Its composition is listed in Table 3.2.\nMacConkey agar is differential as it contains a sugar and the pH indicator neutral red, which can help to distinguish between bacteria which are able to metabolise the sugar, and those which cannot. It is often supplemented with lactose, but can also be supplemented with other sugars, such as sorbitol. Fermentation of the sugar produces acid, causing precipitation of the bile salts present in the medium and a change in colour due to the pH indicator. Bacteria that are not able to ferment the sugars will instead utilise the amino acids present in the medium, producing ammonia and causing the pH to increase.\nTherefore, following culture on MacConkey/lactose medium, strong lactose fermenters such as Escherichia species will produce red colonies with a surrounding zone of precipitated bile sometimes observable. The red colour is due to the indicator changing colour in response to acid production following lactose fermentation.\nSlow or weak lactose fermenters such as Citrobacter and Serratia species may appear colourless after 24 hours or slightly pink after 24 - 48 hours.\nNon-lactose fermenting microorganisms such as Proteus, Salmonella and Shigella species, with rare exceptions produce colourless or clear transparent colonies.\nCASE STUDY 6. The case of the careless clinician.\nYou are working in a clinical microbiology with a friend, who has just left for holiday – leaving you to record the results from the last sample he was processing. You think he said that it was C. diff– or maybe E. coli – he was working on faecal samples earlier that morning. But you aren’t entirely sure and he isn’t answering his phone. (You need to get better friends.)\nThe patient can’t wait for a diagnosis until your friend gets back from his holiday, so you’d better figure it out for him. Your task is to determine whether the isolated pathogen is Clostridium or E. coli using biochemical assays (Task 4C) and by testing whether the pathogen is an obligate or facultative anaerobe (Task 4D).\nAnaerobic conditions: A number of clinically relevant pathogens are obligate anaerobes and therefore must be cultivated anaerobically. In this laboratory, you will learn techniques for the anaerobic growth of microorganisms and perform biochemical assays to test for the presence of enzymes involved in aerobic growth. These complementary assays will help you to determine whether this clinical specimen is an anaerobe or an aerobe, and therefore aid in species identification.\nTASK 3C: Biochemical assays to identify pathogens of the intestinal tract\nTest 1: Catalase test\nCatalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The enzyme is a haem protein expressed by most aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria (excluding Streptococci species) and used to degrade any hydrogen peroxide that is generated during aerobic carbohydrate metabolism.\nTest 2: Oxidase test\nCytochrome oxidase is a haemprotein enzyme that is involved in the terminal chain of aerobic respiration by transferring electrons (hydrogen) to oxygen, to form water. It is possessed by aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms. The test is helpful in screening Enterobacteriaceae (all negative), Pseudomonas (positive) or Neisseria (positive) species. The oxidase test uses a dye that can substitute for oxygen as an electron acceptor. In the reduced state the dye is colourless. However, in the presence of cytochrome oxidase and atmospheric oxygen it becomes oxidized and converts to a coloured derivative.\nTASK 3D: Determining whether the unknown microorganism requires oxygen for growth\nThere are a number of different techniques used in microbiology laboratories for achieving anaerobic conditions to permit the growth of different microbes. In this lab, you will use two different techniques: use of thioglycollate medium and use of an anaerobic jar.\nThioglycollate medium\nThis medium contains a reducing agent, sodium thioglycollate, that binds to and consumes O2 and thus maintains a low oxygen tension in the medium. The medium also contains a redox indicator, resazurin, which turns pink in an oxidized environment. It is essential to use fresh thioglycollate medium (as indicated by the absence of pink colour). Growth of organisms in thioglycollate medium will depend on their oxygen requirements, as illustrated in Figure 3.1.\nThe GasPak/Anaerobic jar technique\nThis system uses a sealed jar and a GasPak, which generates carbon dioxide and hydrogen; a palladium catalyst in the jar combines the hydrogen with oxygen (generating water); this then creates an anaerobic atmosphere in the jar, as shown in Figure 3.2. An indicator strip is used to verify that anaerobic conditions have been established: it contains methylene blue, which becomes colourless in the absence of oxygen.\nYou will streak two agar plates; one will be incubated aerobically; the other, anaerobically. Each plate should be divided in half (use a marker-pen to draw a line on the base of the plate). You will inoculate one half of each plate with your unknown organism and one half with Clostridium as a control. As Clostridium will only grow anaerobically, its growth in this experiment will confirm that anaerobic conditions were achieved in the jar with the Gas-Pak.\nTASK 3F: Staphylococcus aureus inoculation on mannitol salt agar\nMannitol salt agar (MSA) is a selective differential medium that is used for primary isolation and identification of potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus from non-pathogenic commensal microorganisms from the genus Micrococcus. MSA contains a relatively high sodium chloride content of 7.5% w/v which allows selection for microorganisms that can tolerate this level of sodium chloride. This makes the test selective. In addition, it contains mannitol and an indicator, phenol red. If a microorganism can ferment the mannitol, acid will be produced and the indicator will turn from red to yellow in response to the pH drop. This makes the test differential.\nStaphylococcus aureus grows on MSA and ferments mannitol, turning the plate yellow. Microorganisms such as Staphylococcus epidermis although capable of growth on MSA, do not ferment mannitol. Members of the genus Micrococcus (e.g. Micrococcus luteus) cannot grow on MSA.",

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. In this laboratory session, you will be identifying a pathogen of the skin and circulatory system, Staphylococcus aureus, using differential media (Task 4A), biochemical assays (Tasks 4B and 4C), and a PCR-based technique called MVLA typing (Task 4D).\nStaphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are both members of the normal human skin flora (commensals), and dangerous pathogens often associated with nosocomial infections. Although Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis appear very similar when examined under the microscope (as in the Gram-staining procedure you carried out in laboratory session 1), they can be distinguished from one another on the basis of several different phenotypic characteristics (Table 4.1).\nCASE STUDY 4: Epidemiology of an MRSA outbreak\nA number of patients at the local hospital have been acquiring secondary infections after seeing Dr. X for routine medical procedures. However, many of the patients also move in the same social circles, and so it is not clear whether these infections are nosocomial or community-acquired.\nAs a consulting microbiologist from the NHS, you have been asked to help the hospital discover the source of the pathogens, so that they can clean up their protocols for infection control if necessary. The first step is to determine whether the bacteria isolated from the patients are all genetically identical (from the same source) or different (from different sources).\nYou will use selective and differential media to analyse your own commensal flora (results from laboratory session 2, Task 3E) and the unknown and control strains from the MRSA epidemic (Task 3A).\nYour task is to identify the strains involved in the outbreak. You suspect that it is MRSA, but you must first confirm this. You will first determine whether the patient isolates are in fact Staphylococci using a lysostaphin test (Task 3B); you will then determine whether they are Staphylococcus aureus or other Staphylococci using a diagnostic coagulase test (Task 3C). Finally, you will identify a Staphylococcus aureus isolate using MVLA typing (Task 3D).\nCoagulase is an enzyme that has prothrombin-like activity and is capable of converting plasma fibrinogen to fibrin with resultant clot formation. Coagulase can be present in two forms, “free” and “bound” each having different properties and requiring different testing procedures. In this laboratory we will use the more rapid test for bound coagulase, the so-called slide test. As not all strains of Staphylococcus aureus express bound coagulase a negative test result requires the free coagulase (tube) test to be performed for absolute confirmation.\nIf the previous tests have allowed you to determine that your unknown is Staphylococcus aureus, you will now be able to determine its identity more precisely using a technique called MLVA (multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis), which can discriminate between different strains of Staphylococcus aureus based on different numbers of variable tandem repeats in specific loci. You will amplify these loci using PCR, and determine the size of the PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the locus (PCR product) reflects the number of repeats present in your strain. If more repeats are present, the PCR product will be larger (see Figure 4.1). If your unknown was not Staphylococcus aureus, you will still be able to perform the MLVA analysis – use the Staphylococcus aureus culture that was provided as a positive control for the previous experiments.\nYou will be analysing five different loci in total; one in a single PCR reaction (the spa gene) in Protocol 4.3, and four in a multiplexed PCR reaction (the clfA, cflB, sdr, and ssp genes) as detailed in Protocol 4.4.",

    "text": "TASK 4A: Microbial colonies on MSA plates (from Task 2E)\nYou will analyse the growth and colony morphology of the unknown pathogen on MSA agar, and also the growth and colony morphology of your own nasal flora (from the plates you inoculated in laboratory session 2, Task 2E). You have also been provided with cultures of type strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis grown on MSA agar as controls. Record your observations in Table 4.2.\nProtocol 4.2: Coagulase slide test.\n\nPlace a drop of sterile water on a glass slide.\nUsing a flamed loop, that has been allowed to cool, remove an isolated colony from the culture plate and gently emulsify on the slide with the drop of sterile water. \nPlace a drop of plasma immediately adjacent to the bacterial suspension and mix the two samples together.\nGently tilt the slide back and forwards, observing for the immediate formation of a white precipitate.\n\nInterpretation\nA positive reaction (formation of white precipitate) is typically detected 15 – 20 seconds. The test is considered negative if clumping is not observed within 2 – 3 minutes.\nSetting up PCR reaction mixtures\n• Work on ice. • Pipet carefully and accurately. • Watch what you touch – you are covered with nucleases and your own Staphylococcus aureus! • Stay organized – keep track of what you have added to your reaction and what still needs to be added. • Label your tubes – there will be 96 on the thermocycler altogether!\nProtocol 4.3: Set up single PCR (spa gene).\nThe spa gene must be amplified separately as these primers do not perform well in the multiplex PCR reaction. The single PCR mixture contains: primers for the gene to be amplified (the spa gene), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq), dNTPs, the reaction buffer, and PCR-grade water.\n\nLabel your PCR tube carefully with the gene name (spa) and your bench number.\nUse a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.\nKeep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step (thermocycler).\n\nProtocol 4.4: Set up multiplex PCR (clfA, clfB, sdr and ssp genes).\nThe multiplex PCR mixture contains: primers for each of the genes to be amplified (the cflA, cflB, sdr, and ssp genes), the template DNA, the polymerase enzyme (Taq polymerase), dNTPs, and the reaction buffer.\n\nLabel your PCR tube carefully, including your bench number.\nUse a white thin (10 μl) tip to pick one big isolated colony from the plate provided to you, and place this at the bottom of your PCR tube. Add 20 μl PCR master mix.\nKeep the reaction mixture on ice until the whole class is ready to proceed to the amplification step.\n\nPCR amplification for both reactions\nAmplification of DNA fragments will be performed with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, and one minute at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes on a Bio-Rad DNA-Engine thermocycler. This PCR programme takes about 2½ hours to run.\nProtocol 4.5: Make an agarose gel.\n\nPrepare a gel tray. Use tape to seal off the top and bottom ends. Insert the comb in the slots in the tray. Check with a demonstrator before proceeding.\nA 2% agarose solution has been made for you as follows: 2 g of agarose were added to a glass flask, and 100 ml 1X TAE buffer. The agarose solution was heated in a microwave till agarose is completely dissolved in the buffer, and then cooled down to about 50°C.\nPour the agarose into your prepared gel tray and leave it to set.\n\nGel electrophoresis\nAfter the thermocycler run has finished, your samples will be run on your gel for you as follows: we will add 5 µl of spa PCR product to the multiplex PCR products and then run 16 µl of the combined reaction on the 2% agarose gel. Bioline 100bp DNA ladder (BIO-33056) will be used for each of the gels. We will then take gel images with the “gel doc system” and post your data to the BM327 microbiology class sub-page.\nYou will need to observe the growth of your unknown and control strains on selective/differential media and record your results in Table 4.8.\nProtocol 4.6: Determining the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic\n\nPrepare a seed lawn for each of your three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate as follows: pipette 100 µl of the supplied culture onto the centre of a Mueller Hinton agar plate and use a sterile plastic spreader to distribute the culture evenly over the surface of the agar. The liquid should be completely absorbed into the agar before you add the antibiotic disks in step 5.\nObtain an empty petri dish containing fifteen sterile filter discs.\nIn four sterile 1.5 ml tubes, prepare dilutions of the supplied solution of gentamicin (1 mg/ml). You will be adding 20 µl of each dilution to a filter disk, but it is always a good idea to prepare a slightly larger volume to account for any pipetting errors - e.g. prepare 25 µl for each filter disk. Prepare the dilutions so that you will end up with 4 µg, 8 µg, 12 µg and 16 µg of gentamicin when you add 20 µl of the dilution to a filter disk.\n\nEquation: C1 x V1 = C2 x V2 [C, concentration; V, volume]\nExample: 4 µg/20 µl x 25 µl = 1 mg/ml x ???\nUsing this equation, complete the following table and then prepare the dilutions:\nTable 4.11: Calculation of antibiotic dilutions",

    "text": "TASK 4F: Analysing antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates\nBacteria in biofilms tend to be more resistant to killing and/or growth inhibition by antimicrobial agents. A number of different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this increased resistance, including that the biofilms may provide a measure of physical protection, i.e. with an extracellular matrix shielding the cells from contact with the antimicrobial agent. Alternatively, the cells present in a biofilm may have altered their gene expression/physiological state such that they are now more resistant to the antimicrobial. In this lab, you will test your Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates to determine whether they are sensitive or resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin.\nIntroduction\nThere are many different techniques available to the clinical microbiologist who wishes to make a definitive identification of a potential pathogen. Many of these use the fact that different bacterial species have characteristic physiological and biochemical characteristics that can help to identify them. In this laboratory session, you will be looking at some of the phenotypic properties of bacteria that can contribute to their virulence (Case study 2, Tasks 2A and 2B) and using a differential stain to identify a potential pathogen (Case study 3, Task 2C).\nYou will also finish the experiment you started in the last laboratory (Case study 1, Task 1C) in Task 2D this week. In Task 2E, you will use selective and differential media to isolate bacteria for laboratory session 3.\nCASE STUDY 2: Cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder (autosomal recessive) that mostly affects the lungs, with patients contracting infections due to mucus build-up, decreased mucocilliary clearance, and increased inflammation. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly infect the lungs of CF patients. These are usually chronic, life-long infections, dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their later stages.\nIn this clinical study, we are interested in which factors make Pseudomonas aeruginosa a successful pathogen in the CF lung. You will characterise the Pseudomonas sp. isolated from several different patients: you will analyse their ability to form biofilms (Task 2A) and their resistance to antibiotics (Task 2B\nTASK 5A: Analysing biofilm attachment of P. aeruginosa isolates\nBiofilm formation is a key virulence factor for many clinically important pathogens, and is also a particular problem in healthcare situations, where biofilms can form on medical devices and be difficult to eradicate. Bacteria in biofilms are often more resistant to killing by antibiotics. Biofilm formation is a complex, regulated process that begins with the initial attachment of bacteria to a surface, often mediated by flagella, pili, or other surface proteins on the bacterial cell. This surface attachment is what you will measure using a crystal violet stain that binds to the bacteria.\nYou will be provided with a tube of medium, and three liquid cultures of Pseudomonas which have been grown overnight in that same medium. You will test whether these Pseudomonas sp. are able to form biofilms using a crystal violet assay (Protocol 5.1).\nCrystal violet will stain the bacteria but not the plastic. Therefore, attachment will be observed by the presence of a purple ring (see Figure 5.2 below). This purple ring is made up of bacteria that have attached to the surface at the liquid-air interface.",

    "text": "Protocol 5.1: Biofilm formation assay.\n\nPipette 100 µl of medium into well A1: this is your negative control. Pipette 100 µl into three separate wells for each of the three Pseudomonas cultures. This will ensure you have triplicate samples for each culture. As you will be sharing a 96-well plate, be sure to carefully record the location of each sample - i.e. culture 1, wells B1, B2 and B3 etc.\nIncubate the cells at 30°C for 30 minutes.\nAdd 25 µl of 1% crystal violet solution to each well.\nIncubate the plate for a further 15 minutes at room temperature.\nAfter this time, rinse the wells thoroughly with water and invert the tray over some blue-roll paper to let the wells drain carefully.\nRecord your observations in Table 2.1 using the qualitative scores given above (+++, ++, +, 0).\n\nTASK 5B: Analysing antibiotic resistance assay (from Task 2B)\nYou should carefully measure the diameter of each zone of inhibition in millimetres. Put your results in Table 5.2.\nCASE STUDY 3. Tuberculosis?\nPatient history: fever, persistent cough, weight loss, loss of appetite. The patient is immunocompromised and has recently travelled extensively outside the UK.\nThe patient is positive for the Tb skin test, but has had the BCG vaccine and so this may be a false positive. The clinician suspects that it may in fact be an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and takes a sputum sample and sends it to the lab for analysis. The sample was plated on Löwenstein–Jensen medium and colonies were then isolated into pure culture.\nYour task is to identify the bacterial species causing this infection (Task 2C).\nTASK 5C: Using differential stain to identify a respiratory tract pathogen\nCertain microorganisms, in particular mycobacteria, have the power to retain specific stains even when they are decolourised by mineral acids. They are therefore referred to as being “acid-fast”. The ability of mycobacteria to resist decolourisation is due to the presence of high amounts of mycolic acid within their cell wall structure. Therefore, you can use this stain to determine whether the infectious agent in this case is a mycobacterium or not. You should carry out the staining procedure on positive and negative controls (acid-fast and non-acid-fast bacteria) as well as on your unknown.\nProtocol 5.2: Modified Ziehl-Neelson stain.\n\nHold a glass slide with metal forceps and flame thoroughly its operational upper surface using a Bunsen flame. Allow the slide to cool. Flame a loop until red hot and leave it to cool. Place a loopful of sterile water on the upper surface of the slide. Flame the loop again and allow it to cool, then use it to pick up a speck of a colony from the culture provided. Mix this speck thoroughly into the drop of water to form a dilute milky suspension covering an area of about the size of a 20p coin.\nAllow the film to dry completely. You may need to do this by warming the slide gently, holding it in forceps well above the Bunsen’s flame.\nFix the film of cells to the slide by passing the lower surface of the slide through the Bunsen flame slowly twice. The slide will now be hot to the touch; allow it to cool.\nPlace the slide on the staining rack over the sink.\nCover the slide with carbol fuchsin solution (this contains phenol, so take care to avoid contact with skin. Wash hands immediately if this happens). Allow to stand for 5 min.\nRinse with water.\n\nTake great care, wear protective gloves and safety spectacles now to handle the next solution (hydrochloric acid in ethanol) which is corrosive!\n\nDecolourise the slide by covering it with hydrochloric acid in ethanol solution, and allow to stand for 15 - 30 seconds.\nImmediately remove excess acid by running slide in tap water.\nCounterstain with malachite green solution for one minute.\nRemove excess stain with water.\nGently blot dry and examine with the oil-immersion lens (x100).",

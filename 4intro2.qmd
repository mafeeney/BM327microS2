## Biochemical assays

### Lysostaphin assay

A diagnostic characteristic of staphylococci is their sensitivity to lysostaphin, an enzyme that cleaves the pentaglycine bridge present in the peptidoglycan cell wall of these microorganisms (@fig-lysostaphin). (Other Gram-positive bacteria like <i>Micrococcus</i> sp. lack this pentaglycine bridge and are therefore resistant to lysostaphin.)

<b>Protocol: Lysostaphin sensitivity test</b>

1.	Use a sterilised inoculating loop to transfer an isolated colony from agar plate to a tube containing 0.2 ml phosphate-saline buffer, and emulsify the colony in the buffer until the cells are well-suspended.

2.	Transfer half of the suspended cells to another tube and mix with 0.1 ml phosphate-saline buffer (this will be your control reaction).

3.	Add 0.1 ml lysostaphin (dissolved in 0.02 M phosphate-saline buffer containing 1% NaCl) to original tube for concentration of 25 µg lysostaphin/ml.

4.	Incubate both tubes at 37°C for two hours.

Interpretation

A positive reaction is detected by clearing of bacterial turbidity (cell lysis).
The test is considered negative if clearing has not occurred after 2 hours.

### Coagulase assay

Coagulase is an enzyme that has prothrombin-like activity and is capable of converting plasma fibrinogen to fibrin with resultant clot formation. 

Coagulase can be present in two forms, “free” and “bound” each having different properties and requiring different testing procedures. 

In this laboratory we will use the more rapid test for bound coagulase, the so-called slide test (@fig-coagulaseslide)

As not all strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> express bound coagulase a negative test result requires the free coagulase (tube) test to be performed for absolute confirmation (@fig-coagulasetube).

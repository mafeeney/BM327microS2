Aims

•	To understand how to examine microorganisms, both at the macroscopic (colony morphology), and the microscopic (including the use of appropriate staining techniques) scale.

Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

•	How to identify microorganisms from their macroscopic characteristics.
•	How to identify microorganisms from their microscopic characteristics.
•	How to use differential media to identify bacterial species.


Competencies

•	Using aseptic technique.
•	Observing colony morphology of bacterial and eukaryotic microorganisms.
•	Preparing and viewing specimens for examination using microscopy.
•	Using appropriate methods to identify microorganisms (differential stains and media).
•	Documenting and reporting on experimental results and conclusions.


Importance

This laboratory session aligns with lectures and reinforces material relating to bacterial morphology, bacterial cell wall structure, bacterial identification and phylogeny, fungal classification.

# Aims

To understand how to identify unknown microorganisms using molecular and media-based techniques.

# Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

* How to characterise bacterial species from their ability to form biofilms.

* How to characterise bacteria species from their antibiotic resistance.

* How to identify a potential pathogen using differential staining.

# Competencies

{{< include ./_includes/lab5comp.qmd >}}


# Importance

This laboratory session aligns with lectures and reinforces material relating to respiratory tract pathogens, bacterial metabolism, bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, bacterial identification and clinical microbiology.

## Overview of Lab 5

In this lab session, you will be learning (or further developing your skills in) a number of key microbiology skills:

1. You will perform an assay to measure biofilm formation (Task 5A)

2. You will observe and analyse the results from your Kirby Bauer disk diffusion assays (Task 5B)

3. You will perform a differential stain (acid-fast stain) to help identify a respiratory tract pathogen (Task 5C)

::: {.todo title="To prepare for Lab 5"}

Before attending the practical lab, you should ensure that you have read and understood:

* The introductory sections covering the theory on [identification of intestinal pathogens](./3intro1.qmd), 

* The [Protocols](./5protocols.qmd) we will be following in the lab

You also must ensure that you have read and signed the safety forms, or you will not be admitted to the lab.

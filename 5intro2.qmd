CASE STUDY 7. Tuberculosis?

Patient history: fever, persistent cough, weight loss, loss of appetite. The patient is immunocompromised and has recently travelled extensively outside the UK.

The patient is positive for the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/testing/skin-test.html">Tb skin test</a>, but has had the BCG vaccine and so this may be a false positive. The clinician suspects that it may in fact be an infection by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and takes a sputum sample and sends it to the lab for analysis. The sample was plated on Löwenstein–Jensen medium and colonies were then isolated into pure culture.

Your task is to identify the bacterial species causing this infection (Task 5C).

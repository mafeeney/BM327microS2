Aims

•	To understand how to identify unknown microorganisms using molecular and media-based techniques.

Learning Outcomes

At the end of this laboratory session, you should understand:

•	How to characterise bacterial species from their ability to form biofilms.
•	How to characterise bacteria species from their antibiotic resistance.
•	How to identify a potential pathogen using differential staining.

Competencies

•	Using aseptic technique.
•	Performing calculations and preparing solutions.
•	Pipetting.
•	Using pure culture and selective techniques to enrich for, and isolate, microorganisms.
•	Using appropriate methods to identify microorganisms (microscopy, media-based and molecular techniques).
•	Documenting and reporting on experimental results and conclusions.


Importance

This laboratory session aligns with lectures and reinforces material relating to respiratory tract pathogens, bacterial metabolism, bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, bacterial identification and clinical microbiology.

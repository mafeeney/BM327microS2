IMPORTANT NOTE: A link to all Safety Paperwork (eCOSHH and eRisk Assessments) for each appropriate laboratory will be sent to you in an email a few days before the session. These electronic documents MUST be read ahead of each laboratory and acknowledgement of this indicated by ticking the box that is at the end of the document. This MUST be done at least ONE day ahead of the session. Failure to do this will result in you not being allowed into the laboratory session. A link to the electronic document will also be available on the appropriate BM327 Being a Biomolecular Scientist 3 class sub-page on Myplace.

It is essential that you prepare thoroughly for these labs by reviewing each section and that you understand fully what you are doing in each lab. If in doubt, ask a member of staff.

## Introduction to the BM327 Microbiology Semester 2 Lab Manual

This laboratory manual contains key information about each of the five practical laboratory sessions delivered as part of BM327 microbiology semester 2. 

### How to use this manual

You can navigate through this manual using the sidebar on the left.

The introductory section is a general section containing helpful information on good laboratory technique, working with microorganisms safely and aseptically, etc. - it also contains general information about the module, including the assessment. You should read through this section before the first lab and refer back to it when needed to refresh your memory.

Each of the laboratory sections 1-5 contain a brief explanation of the theory underpinning the practical lab session, the protocols that will be used in that lab, and an explanation of any data analysis tasks that need to be performed after the lab. Links to the protocols (handouts) for each lab are provided, but please note that you do not need to print these out - they will be provided for you in the laboratories. 

You should read through the relevant theory/introductory material before coming to each practical lab session, and make sure you understand it. In some instances you may wish to review the material covered in BM329 before the lab as well (the two modules are linked, and intend to give you practical experience with working with some of the organisms discussed in your lectures).

If you notice any errors (including typos, broken links, etc.) please feel free to notify Dr Feeney, either by e-mail or by [raising an issue](https://github.com/mafeeney/BM327microS2/issues/new) on this lab manual's github page.

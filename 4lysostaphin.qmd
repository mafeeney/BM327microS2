TASK 4B:	Assaying for lysostaphin sensitivity

Another diagnostic characteristic of Staphylococci sp. is their sensitivity to lysostaphin, an enzyme that cleaves the pentaglycine bridge present in the peptidoglycan cell wall of these microorganisms. (Other Gram-positive bacteria like Micrococcus sp. lack this pentaglycine bridge and are therefore resistant to lysostaphin.)

Protocol 4.1: Lysostaphin sensitivity test.

1.	Use a sterilised inoculating loop to transfer an isolated colony from agar plate to a tube containing 0.2 ml phosphate-saline buffer, and emulsify the colony in the buffer until the cells are well-suspended.

2.	Transfer half of the suspended cells to another tube and mix with 0.1 ml phosphate-saline buffer (this will be your control reaction).

3.	Add 0.1 ml lysostaphin (dissolved in 0.02 M phosphate-saline buffer containing 1% NaCl) to original tube for concentration of 25 µg lysostaphin/ml.

4.	Incubate both tubes at 37°C for not more than two hours.

Interpretation

A positive reaction is detected by clearing of bacterial turbidity (cell lysis).
The test is considered negative if clearing has not occurred after 2 hours.
